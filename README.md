 Requirements

Structure

Done -  Header with minor navigation (Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)

Done -  Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation (search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)

Done -  Main section to contain the font cards 

Done - Font cards which display the Font Name, the sample text, and an add button

Done -  Footer section with your developer information
Style

Done - Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font

Done - Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)

Done - Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable

Functionality

 Text typed into the custom text (type something) box immediately changes the sample text displayed in each font card
 
 The sample text returns to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
 
 Font size chooser  have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
  
 Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it makes the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (do not actually reload the page)
